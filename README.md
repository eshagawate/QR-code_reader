# QR Code Scanner with ESP32 CAM Module

This project aims to create a QR code scanner or reader using the ESP32 CAM module and OpenCV. By developing a program and device with Python libraries, we can easily scan QR codes using the ESP32 Camera module. This ESP32 CAM module provides a more affordable alternative.

QR codes have become an integral part of our daily lives, as we use them for a variety of purposes, including payments, accessing websites, and sharing social profiles on resumes. Additionally, large tracking and shipping companies use QR codes to differentiate their products.

ESP32 CAM Module

The ESP32 from Espressif Systems is a powerful dual-core microcontroller with built-in wireless that makes it a perfect fit for many creative Internet of Things projects. The ESP32-CAM development board takes it one step further by combining that speedy microcontroller with a camera module!

The ESP32 CAM module, developed by AI-Thinker, is based on a 32-bit CPU.
It has features of combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth/BLE chips. 
It has 520 KB of built-in SRAM and an external 4M PSRAM. 
The module’s GPIO pins support various interfaces, including UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, ADC, and DAC.
The module is equipped with the OV2640 camera module, which boasts the highest camera resolution of up to 1600 × 1200. 
The camera connects to the ESP32 CAM board via a 24-pin gold-plated connector. 
Additionally, the board supports SD cards of up to 4GB, which can be used to store captured images.
